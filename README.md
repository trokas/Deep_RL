# Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents

Some time ago I ran into great RL tutorial series on [Medium](https://medium.com/@awjuliani/simple-reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow-part-0-q-learning-with-tables-and-neural-networks-d195264329d0#.4gyadb8a4). Since *pyTorch* is much easier to interpret than *tensorflow* you will find reimplementation of some algorithms used in original series. Notebooks will also contain my own comments and some small improvements. I highly recommend to read original tutorial series posts and then play with notebooks (numbering is based on series). I plan to add more notebooks later.

Hopefully this repo will be useful complementary material to original series.
